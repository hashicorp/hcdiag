```release-note:breaking
Op: Change the response type from any to map[string]any. Results for every runner are now stored under a key. This change enables Ops to return other ops, keyed by ID, and will allow runners to reference the ops from previous runners' results.
```
```release-note:improvement
runner: Add new Runner implementation. `Do` takes a slice of Runners and executes all of them concurrently.
```
```release-note:improvement
runner: Add new Runner implementation: `DoSync` takes a slice of Runners and executes them in linear order. If the status is not Success, subsequent Runners do not execute. DoSync enables dependent Runner sets.
```
