```release-note:breaking
runner: The "runner" object in Results.json has been renamed to "params". It is now omitted if the Runner doesn't take params.
```
```release-note:improvement
runner: The Seeker type has been reworked into the immutable Op struct, and Runners return an Op rather than being stored on a seeker. This should make contributing Runners significantly easier, and simplifies reporting.
```
