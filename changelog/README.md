# changelog

Release notes are text files with three lines:

1. An opening code block with the `release-note:<MODE>` type annotation.

   For example:

       ```release-note:bug

   Valid modes are:

    - `bug` - Any sort of non-security defect fix.
    - `security` - Any fixes for security issues in previous versions.
    - `breaking` - Shorthand for a breaking change. These are changes that
      alter an existing API contract or fundamentally update behavior in a way
      that a user should be aware of before upgrading. Note that backward-compatible
      changes are considered `improvement`s and should be labeled as such.
    - `deprecation` - Announcement of a planned future removal of a
      feature.
    - `feature` - Large topical additions for a major release. These are
      rarely in minor releases. Formatting for `feature` entries differs
      from normal changelog formatting - see the [new features
      instructions](#new-and-major-features).
    - `improvement` - Most updates to the product that arenâ€™t `bug`s, but
      aren't big enough to be a `feature`, will be an `improvement`.

2. A component (for example, `seeker` or `agent`), a colon and a space,
and then a one-line description of the change.

3. An ending code block.

This should be in a file named after the pull request number (e.g., `12345.txt`).

See [hashicorp/go-changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-changelog) for full documentation on the supported entries.

## New and Major Features

For features that we are introducing in a new major release, we prefer a single
changelog entry representing that feature. This way, it is clear to readers
what feature is being introduced. You do not need to reference a specific PR,
and the formatting is slightly different - your changelog file should look
like:

    changelog/<pr num OR feature name>.txt:
    ```release-note:feature
    **Feature Name**: Description of feature - for example "Custom password policies are now supported for all database engines."
    ```
