hcdiag simplifies debugging HashiCorp products by automating shared and product-specific diagnostics data collection
on individual nodes. Running the binary issues a set of operations that read the current state of the system then write
the results to a tar.gz bundle.

DEPRECATION NOTICE:
To maintain backward compatibility for a short time, you may execute a local diagnostic run using 'hcdiag [<args>]'.
However, this will be deprecated in an upcoming release. You should begin using the 'run' subcommand for such purposes.
For guidance on available options for running local execution, please refer to the help output from 'run' by using
'hcdiag run --help'.
